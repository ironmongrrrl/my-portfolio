      <div class="Encounter subheader subheadmargin">The First Encounter</div>

    <div class="Born">Born in 1988, I grew up in Edinburgh, I was an incredibly shy but naughty child by all accounts. Things started a bit tumultuously because of my parents (who'd have them?). 7 primary schools later I finally landed at 13 in North Wales in with my grandparents. It was there I had my first brush with a computer. As a surprise for my Grandma, we set one up for her to write her  memoirs. She only actually used it for Solitaire, but it gave her a lot of joy. Intrigue got the better of me too, and I found myself settling into the groove in that back room, grinding hours on it before school setting up a marketplace on Neopets (a virtual pet website) in HTML, earning Neopoints. And playing Age of Empires, of course.

    <div class="Smells subheader topmargin">Smells like teen spirit</div>

    <div class="Life big-quote-left subheadmargin">Life is not a dress rehearsal</div>

    <div class="Skip">Skip to 2007, where we'd been living with my Dad. Having a very strict, religious upbringing does have its perks, not just being able to recite the 66 books of the Bible! My sister and I weren't allowed to watch TV, so I spent inordinate amounts of time on Encarta, Napster, MSN messenger and questionable chatrooms was fine (go figure). I'd built my own PC by this time which was good fun, but I still didn't connect the dots with pursuing tech at this point. 
      </div>

    <div class="Thrown subheader subheadmargin">Getting the hell out of dodge</div>

    <div class="My-Dad">My Dad was unsurprisingly against me going any uni that meant leaving home. Despite his, he wanted me to do well in my GCSEs and said he would give me £50 for every A or A*. Bad move on his part as it left him £700 down, but he did honour it. This is the money I bought my first car with, and with moments like this, I was starting to discover that determination can change the story being written.
      <br><br>
      Deciding what to do at uni was tough as I was enjoying both English and Law, along with Maths and Physics. Looking back, there was so little direction that being funnelled into uni at that age by teachers now seems ridiculous. 
      <br><br>    
      I ended up going the English Literature route for the simple reason that my English teacher was hilarious and inspiring. With hindsight, I wish I'd waited a few years to think it out - maybe now I'd have Software Engineering BSc instead. But hey, that's not how things worked out.  However there is a twist.

    <div class="Sliding subheader topmargin">Sliding Doors</div>

    <div class="At-Birmingham rightindent">
      Whilst at Uni, I met a friend called Anna Balquin, who was studying Philosophy. We'll come back to her.
      <br><br>
      Life got kind of busy between 18 - 30. I fell in love with DJing at uni, which took me to Manchester where I then studied music production. I met some influential females along the way, and we started (and still run) what is widely considered Manchester's biggest techno night.
      <br><br> The electronic music school that I studied at hired me when I finished, as I was basically a constant nuisance wanting to write their blog and pushing business growth ideas on them. I grew through the roles as we grew the business. I spent many years as a course advisor, talking to people all day long, which I loved. I also discovered I was a spreadsheet nerd, and got a huge kick from designing systems that keep all the plates spinning. I'm now Operations Director, and proud that over the 8 years we've built the company from 5 to 30 staff.

    <div class="In-My rightindent">
    In my first week at Birmingham University in 2007, I had a revelatory moment that changed my life forever. Much to my horror, I got accepted for a job working at the uni bar, which was extremely intimidating a) because my Dad had never really cared to take us to a bar or pub before and b) people. Lots of confident, chatty people. 
    <br><br>
    Stood in the circle with the 19 other members of staff they were hiring, I was miles out of my comfort zone. I felt myself making an excuse to sack the job off. Around me, everyone was asking each other what degrees they were studying. It dawned on me that I could say whatever I wanted to. Medicine? Sure. Law? Why not. 
    <br><br>
    I realised then that these people didn't know me. This wasn't a backwater North Wales town anymore, and I didn't need to be the weird awkward one. I didn't need to lie about my degree, but also I certainly didn't need the imprint of my previous ten years following me around either. I could be who I wanted to be. So I faked it from that moment, and acted as a confident person would. Full on acting. And with each shift, and each new person I chatted to over the bar, I realised it didn't feel like acting anymore. It was a huge turning point in my life, and has dramatically changed me (pun intended). Now, I love talking to people. Everyone has a story. 
  </div>

    <div class="Life-Gets subheader topmargin">For the record</div>
    
    <div class="Taking subheader topmargin">Taking the plunge</div>
   
    <div class="So"> 
      So here's the rub. Both Anna over the decades made our separate ways to living in Manchester. She then came to me in 2019 saying she was struggling with her career path (teaching languages). I was totally biased as I had my head in a Udemy course on web development at this point, so emphatically recommended that she do coding. Most are smart enough not to take what I say seriously, but Anna cracked on, and got her coding chops on. 
      <br><br>
      We then started to work on some coding projects together, and by 2020 things had escalated. Anna announced she was going to a coding bootcamp, and in doing so she was the catalyst that helped me go 'go on then' and take it a whole lot more seriously. It's the push I needed, and the more I code now, the more I realise it ticks the boxes that I never quite had from my other endeavours. It's a job where I can be constantly learning, constantly pushing myself. And, it has helped me find a community I love. 
      <br><br>
      So there you have it. If I hadn't picked English Literature as my degree, there's a strong possibility it wouldn't have lead me to coding, at least not in my 30s. Funny how things work out.
    </div>

    <div class="There">
      There are 2 things I can definitively say I'm passionate about:
      <br><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Understanding how things work</li>
        <li>Helping others realise they can do it too</li>
      </ul>      
      <br><br>
      The first has led to a number of strange situations, including strategically winning the trip of a lifetime around America (the caveat was that I had to do it entirely dressed as a red panda - my own doing), starting a plumbing business structured to donate 10% to Water Aid, studying electrical installation for 2 years and building my own house (including plumbing and wiring it). And now, coding, in earnest.
      <br><br>
      The second is something that again I feel strongly about. I'm always here if you want a pep talk. If you want someone to look over your finances and work out an investment plan so you can sort your shit out, that's also me (I get an over the top sense of enjoyment from things like this).
